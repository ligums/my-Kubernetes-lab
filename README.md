# My Journey with Talos OS and Kubernetes

This repo documents my journey of setting up and using **Talos OS** with **Kubernetes**. It includes my experiences, challenges, and solutions as I explored these powerful technologies.

## What is Talos OS?

[Talos OS](https://www.talos.dev/) is a minimal, secure operating system designed for Kubernetes. It simplifies cluster management by providing a declarative API for provisioning and configuring nodes.

## Why Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a robust platform for managing containerized applications. I chose Kubernetes for its scalability, automation, and wide industry adoption, making it ideal for my cloud-native workloads.

## My Setup

- **OS**: Talos OS
- **Kubernetes**: v1.32.2
- **Cloud Provider**: self-hosted on proxmox
- **Tools**: `talosctl`, `kubectl`

## Resources

- [Talos OS Docs](https://www.talos.dev/docs/)

Thanks for following along on my Kubernetes and Talos OS journey!
