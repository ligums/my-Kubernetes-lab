# My Journey with Talos OS and Kubernetes

This repo documents my journey of setting up and using **Talos OS** with **Kubernetes**. It includes my experiences, challenges, and solutions as I explored these powerful technologies.

## What is Talos OS?

[Talos OS](https://www.talos.dev/) is a minimal, secure operating system designed for Kubernetes. It simplifies cluster management by providing a declarative API for provisioning and configuring nodes.

## Why Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a robust platform for managing containerized applications. I chose Kubernetes for its scalability, automation, and wide industry adoption, making it ideal for my cloud-native workloads.

## My Setup

- **OS**: Talos OS
- **Kubernetes**: (Version used)
- **Cloud Provider**: (e.g., AWS, GCP, self-hosted)
- **Tools**: `talosctl`, `kubectl`

## Key Steps

1. **Installed Talos OS**: Set up Talos OS on my nodes and configured them via the Talos API.
2. **Kubernetes Setup**: Initialized the Kubernetes cluster using Talos and deployed my first pods.
3. **Networking**: Configured networking with a CNI plugin (e.g., Cilium).
4. **Persistent Storage**: Integrated a storage solution like [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/).

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Networking Issues**: Resolved by choosing the right CNI plugin (Cilium).
- **Persistent Storage**: Solved using [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/).
- **Automation**: Wrote scripts to automate Talos OS setup.
